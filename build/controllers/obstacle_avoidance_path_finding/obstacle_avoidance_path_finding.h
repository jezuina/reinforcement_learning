/*
 * AUTHOR: Carlo Pinciroli <cpinciro@ulb.ac.be>
 *
 * An example diffusion controller for the foot-bot.
 *
 * This controller makes the robots behave as gas particles. The robots
 * go straight until they get close enough to another robot, in which
 * case they turn, loosely simulating an elastic collision. The net effect
 * is that over time the robots diffuse in the environment.
 *
 * The controller uses the proximity sensor to detect obstacles and the
 * wheels to move the robot around.
 *
 * This controller is meant to be used with the XML files:
 *    experiments/diffusion_1.argos
 *    experiments/diffusion_10.argos
